This project is live at [https://gacciny.herokuapp.com/](https://gacciny.herokuapp.com/).

A quick starter repo that includes React, Redux, Redux-Saga and React-router v4. You don't want to worry about developer setup or writing config files then clone this repo and start development mode via `npm start` then explore code. Code is no more than 10 files so it's easy to get staeted with. Good luck :)

## React + Redux + Redux Saga starter kit

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So, it claims all scripts provided by Create React App. Some of them are shown below.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests (https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
